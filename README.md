# Healthcare Costs Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project that aims to predict healthcare costs based on demographic information. The project uses a dataset with features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region to build a regression model for estimating healthcare charges.


## Data

The raw dataset (`insurance.csv`) is available in the `data` directory. It includes the following columns:

- `age`: Age of the insured person.
- `sex`: Gender of the insured person.
- `bmi`: Body mass index of the insured person.
- `children`: Number of children or dependents covered by the insurance.
- `smoker`: Smoking status of the insured person.
- `region`: Geographic region of the insured person.
- `charges`: Healthcare charges incurred by the insured person.

## Setup and Installation
